# Getting Started

Welcome to **Nuvix** — a high-performance backend-as-a-service built for speed and scalability.

This guide walks you through creating your first project, configuring resources, and calling the API — all in just a few minutes.

---

## Why Nuvix?

Nuvix lets you focus on building while we handle the backend infrastructure. Whether you're building a web app, mobile experience, or edge-deployed function — Nuvix provides:

- 🔐 Built-in Authentication
- 📦 Flexible Database & Table Editor
- ☁️ Cloud Functions
- 📁 Secure File Storage
- 🔄 Real-Time APIs
- ⚙️ First-class SDKs (TS, JS, Flutter, etc.)

> ✅ You don’t need to set up databases, auth servers, or queues — it’s all ready out of the box.

---

## 1. Create a Project

Head to the [Nuvix Console](https://console.nuvix.dev) and create a new project.

You’ll be asked to name your project and optionally select a region.

> 💡 You can manage multiple projects under a single organization.

---

## 2. Install the SDK

To start integrating Nuvix in your frontend, install the Nuvix SDK.

### Using npm

```bash
npm install @nuvix/client
```
We recommend using our SDK for authentication, database queries, file uploads, and real-time events.

3. Initialize the Client
Create a new instance of the SDK using your project’s API endpoint and key.

```ts
import { createClient } from '@nuvix/client';

const nuvix = createClient({
  endpoint: 'https://api.nuvix.dev/v1',
  projectId: 'your-project-id',
  apiKey: 'your-secret-key',
});
```
🛡️ Never expose your secret key in public or frontend code. Use anonymous or scoped keys for client usage.

4. Create Your First Table
From the Console, navigate to Database → Tables and click Create Table.

Give it a name like posts, and define a few columns:

title: Text

content: Text (Long)

author_id: UUID

5. Insert Your First Record
Use the SDK or API to insert a document into your table.

```ts
await nuvix.database.insert('posts', {
  title: 'Hello Nuvix',
  content: 'Nuvix is fast, flexible, and scalable.',
  author_id: 'user_abc123',
});
```

6. Query Your Data
```ts
const posts = await nuvix.database.select('posts').where({ author_id: 'user_abc123' });
```
