Get authentication running in your app faster than making coffee. Here's the essentials.

## 1. Create user accounts

Install the Nuvix SDK and create accounts with email and password.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript/TypeScript
import { Client, Account, ID } from "nuvix";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const account = new Account(client);

const user = await account.create({
    userId: ID.unique(), 
    email: 'email@example.com', 
    password: 'password'
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Let them log in

Once they have an account, sign them in with their credentials.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript/TypeScript
const session = await account.createEmailPasswordSession({
    email: email, 
    password: password
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## 3. Check who's logged in

Nuvix SDKs are stateless - you manage the session. Check auth status anytime.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript/TypeScript
try {
    const user = await account.get();
    // User is logged in
} catch (err) {
    // Not logged in - send to login
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## 4. Protect your routes

Check authentication before showing protected content. Here's a React example:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript React Router
import { account } from "./lib/nuvix";
import { redirect } from "react-router-dom";

export async function requireAuth() {
  try {
    const user = await account.get();
    return user;
  } catch {
    throw redirect('/login');
  }
}

// In your router
{
  path: "/dashboard",
  loader: requireAuth,
  element: <Dashboard />
}
```
</CodeGroup>

That's it. You now have working authentication.
