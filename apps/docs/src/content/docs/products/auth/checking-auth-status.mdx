title: Checking auth status
description: Determine if a user is logged in and handle authentication states properly in your Nuvix application.

Your app needs to know: is someone logged in or not? This simple check determines everything - which screens to show, what data to load, and how to handle user interactions.

## The auth check pattern

Use `account.get()` to test authentication status. It either returns user data (logged in) or throws an error (not logged in).

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript/TypeScript
import { Client, Account } from "nuvix";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const account = new Account(client);

async function checkAuthStatus() {
    try {
        const user = await account.get();
        console.log("User logged in:", user.name);
        return { authenticated: true, user };
    } catch (error) {
        console.log("Not logged in");
        return { authenticated: false, user: null };
    }
}

// Run on app startup
checkAuthStatus();
```
</CodeGroup>

## Understanding the error

When `account.get()` fails, you'll see something like:

```
User (role: guests) missing scope (account)
```

This means:
- Current user is unauthenticated (guest role)
- Guest users can't access account data
- This is expected behavior, not a bug

## Authentication flow

**Typical app logic:**

1. App starts → Call `account.get()`
2. Success → User logged in → Load main interface
3. Error → User not logged in → Show login screen

## Implementation tips

**Call it early** - Check auth status before rendering main UI
**Handle both states** - Prepare components for logged in/out scenarios  
**Show loading** - Display spinner while checking authentication
**Cache the result** - Store auth state to avoid repeated checks
**Handle errors gracefully** - Don't show technical errors to users

## Common patterns

**Protected routes:**
```javascript
// Redirect if not authenticated
const auth = await checkAuthStatus();
if (!auth.authenticated) {
    redirect('/login');
}
```

**Conditional rendering:**
```javascript
const { authenticated } = await checkAuthStatus();
return authenticated ? <Dashboard /> : <LoginPage />;
```

**Auto-login check:**
```javascript
// On app load
const authStatus = await checkAuthStatus();
if (authStatus.authenticated) {
    // Skip login screen, go straight to app
    showMainInterface(authStatus.user);
}
```

That's the entire authentication check pattern. One method call tells you everything you need to know about your user's login status.
