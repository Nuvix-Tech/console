title: Anonymous login
description: Create temporary user sessions without email or personal information - perfect for guest access that converts to real accounts.
---

Anonymous sessions let you create user accounts without requiring email, phone, or any personal information. They're regular user accounts that just lack identity credentials.

## How it works

Anonymous users are identical to regular users except:
- No email address
- No phone number  
- No personal identity information
- Same permissions and capabilities as regular users (based on your setup)
- Can be converted to regular accounts anytime

## Create anonymous session

One method call creates a user account without identity data:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript/TypeScript
import { Client, Account } from "nuvix";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const account = new Account(client);

// Create anonymous session
const session = await account.createAnonymousSession();
```
</CodeGroup>

## Convert to regular account

When users provide identity information (email, phone, etc.), convert their anonymous account to a regular user account using any authentication method.

The conversion process:
1. User provides identity (email, phone, social login)
2. Anonymous account gets identity attached
3. Same user ID, now with credentials
4. Session continues uninterrupted

## Common use cases

- **Guest checkout** - Let users shop without signup friction
- **Try before buy** - Demo features before requiring registration  
- **Progressive onboarding** - Collect identity after user sees value
- **Reduced friction** - Lower barrier to entry for new users

## Implementation notes

Anonymous sessions follow the same permission rules as regular users. Their capabilities depend entirely on your app's permission configuration, not on their anonymous status.
