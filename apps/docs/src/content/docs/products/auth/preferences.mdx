description: Store and manage user preferences in Nuvix using Account API and Teams API for individual and shared settings.
---

Preferences allow you to store settings like theme choice, language selection, or notification preferences that are specific to individual users or shared across nx.teams.

## User preferences

You can store user preferences on a user's account using Nuvix's update preferences endpoint.

Preferences are stored as a key-value JSON object. The maximum allowed size for preferences is 64kB, and an error will be thrown if this limit is exceeded.

### Update user preferences

Use the `updatePrefs` method to store user preferences as a JSON object.

```javascript
import { Client } from '@nuvix/client';

const nx = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const prefs = await nx.account.updatePrefs({
    darkTheme: true,
    language: 'en'
});

console.log('Preferences updated:', prefs);
```

### Get user preferences

Retrieve stored preferences with the `getPrefs` method.

```javascript
import { Client } from '@nuvix/client';

const nx = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const preferences = await nx.account.getPrefs();
console.log('User preferences:', preferences);
```

## Team preferences

Team preferences let you store settings that apply to an entire team of users. They are well-suited for collaborative features like team-wide themes, notification preferences, or feature toggles.

Team preferences are stored as a JSON object in the team row and are limited to 64kB of data. All team members can access these shared preferences.

### Update team preferences

Store team-wide settings using the `updatePrefs` method with a team ID.

```javascript
import { Client } from '@nuvix/client';

const nx = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const team = await nx.teams.updatePrefs('<TEAM_ID>', {
    theme: 'corporate',
    notificationsEnabled: true,
    defaultView: 'kanban'
});

console.log('Team preferences updated:', team);
```

### Get team preferences

Fetch team preferences by passing a team ID to the `getPrefs` method.

```javascript
import { Client } from '@nuvix/client';

const nx = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const teamPreferences = await nx.teams.getPrefs('<TEAM_ID>');
console.log('Team preferences:', teamPreferences);
```
