title: Identities
description: Link multiple login methods to one user account - let users connect Google, GitHub, Facebook and more to a single profile.
---

One user, multiple ways to log in. Identities let users connect their Google, GitHub, Facebook, and other accounts to a single Nuvix profile. They can sign in with any connected provider and access the same account.

## How identities work

- **One user account** - Same user ID, same data, same permissions
- **Multiple login methods** - Google today, GitHub tomorrow, email next week
- **Automatic linking** - OAuth2 logins create identities automatically
- **Unified experience** - Same account regardless of sign-in method

## When to use identities

**Social login setup** - User logs in with Google, creates account with Google identity
**Add more providers** - User connects GitHub to existing account  
**Account consolidation** - Multiple social accounts merge into one profile
**Provider switching** - User can disable Facebook, keep Google access

## Creating identities

Identities are created automatically when users authenticate with OAuth2 providers:

```javascript
// User logs in with Google
const session = await nx.account.createOAuth2Session({
    provider: 'google',
    success: 'https://yourapp.com/success',
    failure: 'https://yourapp.com/failure'
});

// Google identity created and linked automatically
```

## Managing multiple providers

Users can connect additional providers to their existing account:

<Steps>
## 1. User must be logged in

They need an active session to add new identities:

```javascript
// Check current user
const user = await nx.account.get();
```

## 2. Connect new provider

Initiate OAuth2 flow for additional provider:

```javascript
// Add GitHub to existing account
await nx.account.createOAuth2Session({
    provider: 'github',
    success: 'https://yourapp.com/connected',
    failure: 'https://yourapp.com/failed'
});
```

## 3. Identity linked automatically

New GitHub identity connects to existing user account.
</Steps>

## Email address management

Each email address must be unique across all users and identities:

- User signs up with `joe@example.com` → Email reserved
- User adds Google identity with `joe@gmail.com` → Gmail also reserved  
- No other user can use either email for new accounts or identities
- Prevents duplicate accounts and identity confusion

## List and manage identities

Check connected providers and remove access:

```javascript
// List all identities for current user
const identities = await nx.account.listIdentities();

// Remove a specific identity (disconnect provider)
await nx.account.deleteIdentity('<IDENTITY_ID>');
```

**Identity data includes:**
- Provider name (google, github, facebook, etc.)
- Provider user ID
- Email address from provider
- Creation date
- Identity ID

## Identity cleanup

When you delete a user account:

- All associated identities removed automatically
- Background job handles cleanup (may be delayed)
- For testing: Manually delete identities before removing user
- Email addresses become available for reuse

## Common patterns

**Check provider connections:**
```javascript
const identities = await nx.account.listIdentities();
const hasGoogle = identities.identities.some(id => id.provider === 'google');
const hasGithub = identities.identities.some(id => id.provider === 'github');
```

**Provider-specific features:**
```javascript
// Use GitHub identity for developer features
const githubIdentity = identities.identities.find(id => id.provider === 'github');
if (githubIdentity) {
    enableDeveloperTools();
}
```

**Account migration:**
```javascript
// Help users find existing accounts
const email = 'user@example.com';
const existing = await nx.account.getIdentityByEmail(email);
if (existing) {
    suggestAccountRecovery();
}
```

Identities simplify user management. One account, many doors - let users choose how they want to log in.
