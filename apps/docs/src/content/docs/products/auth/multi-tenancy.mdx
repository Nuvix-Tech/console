Nuvix Teams provides an effective way to implement multi-tenancy in your applications. Create a team for each tenant to handle multi-tenant apps with built-in data isolation.

## What is multi-tenancy?

Multi-tenancy is a design pattern where a single instance of software serves multiple user groups (tenants). With Nuvix Teams, you can:

- Create a team for each tenant in your application
- Control access to resources using team-based permissions
- Define different roles within each tenant
- Scale to unlimited tenants without code changes

## Common use cases

- **SaaS applications**: Organizations that need isolated data and users
- **Collaborative tools**: Projects with different access levels
- **Educational platforms**: Schools with teachers and students
- **Business software**: Companies with department-based access control

## Create teams for tenants

When a new tenant signs up, create a dedicated team that serves as their isolated environment.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript/TypeScript
import { Client, Teams, ID } from "nuvix";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const teams = new Teams(client);

// Create team for a new tenant
const tenantTeam = await teams.create(
    'example_corp', // Team ID for tenant
    'Example Corp',   // Tenant name
    ['owner', 'admin', 'member'] // Tenant roles
);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Add members to tenants

Invite users to join a tenant using team memberships. Each member can be assigned different roles for access control.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript/TypeScript
import { Client, Teams } from "nuvix";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const teams = new Teams(client);

// Invite a member to the tenant
const membership = await teams.createMembership(
    'example_corp',      // Team/tenant ID
    ['admin'],           // Member's role in the tenant
    'user@example.com',  // User's email
    undefined,           // userId (optional)
    undefined,           // phone (optional)
    'https://example.com/accept-invite' // Redirect URL after accepting
);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Secure resources with team permissions

Control access to rows and resources using team-based permissions. This ensures data isolation between tenants.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript/TypeScript
import { Client, Databases, ID, Permission, Role } from "nuvix";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const databases = new Databases(client);

// Create a document that only members of "Example Corp" tenant can access
const document = await databases.createDocument(
    'invoices_db',
    'invoices',
    ID.unique(),
    {
        title: 'Q2 Invoice',
        amount: 2500.00,
        customer: 'Example Customer',
        status: 'pending',
        tenant_id: 'example_corp'
    },
    [
        // All Example Corp team members can read
        Permission.read(Role.team('example_corp')),

        // Only admins can update
        Permission.update(Role.team('example_corp', ['admin']))
    ]
);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Query tenant data

When querying data, users will automatically only see documents they have permission to access based on their team memberships.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript/TypeScript
import { Client, Databases, Query } from "nuvix";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const databases = new Databases(client);

// Current user will only see invoices they have access to
const documents = await databases.listDocuments(
    'invoices_db',
    'invoices'
);

// For specific tenant data, you can add a query filter
const tenantDocuments = await databases.listDocuments(
    'invoices_db',
    'invoices',
    [
        Query.equal('tenant_id', 'example_corp')
    ]
);
```
</CodeGroup>
