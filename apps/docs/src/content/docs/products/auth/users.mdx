title: Manage users
description: Handle user profiles, settings, and admin tasks with Nuvix's server-side user management tools.
---

The Users API is your admin dashboard in code form. Create users, update profiles, check activity logs, and manage accounts - all from your backend.

## When to use this

**Client apps** → Use the Account API for user-facing features like login and profile updates.

**Server/backend** → Use the Users API for admin tasks like bulk imports, user analytics, and account management.

## What you can build

- **User management systems** - Create, update, and delete user accounts
- **Admin dashboards** - View user activity and manage profiles  
- **Import tools** - Bulk migrate users from other platforms
- **Analytics** - Track user behavior and audit logs
- **Automation** - Use with Nuvix Functions for serverless user workflows

## Key differences

| Feature | Account API (Client) | Users API (Server) |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Who uses it | Your app users | Your backend/admin |
| Authentication | User sessions | API keys |
| Permissions | Respects user permissions | Bypasses permissions |
| Use cases | Login, profile updates | Admin tasks, bulk operations |

## Getting started

Use the Server SDK with an API key that has appropriate scopes:

```javascript
import { Client, Users } from "@nuvix/client";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>')
    .setKey('<API_KEY>'); // Server-side API key

const users = new Users(client);

// List all users
const userList = await users.list();

// Create a new user
const newUser = await users.create(
    ID.unique(),
    'email@example.com',
    '+1234567890',
    '
