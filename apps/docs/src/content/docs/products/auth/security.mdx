Nuvix provides comprehensive security features to keep both your project and your users' information secure. Built with security-first principles, Nuvix handles the complex parts so you can focus on building great applications.

## Session persistence

Nuvix handles session persistence consistently across all platforms. After authenticating, the session persists so users won't need to log in again when they return to your app.

<Info>
Best Practice: Only keep user sessions active as long as needed and maintain exactly **one** instance of the Client SDK in your app to avoid conflicting session data.
</Info>

### Platform-specific storage

| Platform | Storage Method |
|----------|----------------|
| **Web** | Uses secure session cookies with localStorage fallback |
| **Mobile** | Uses secure native storage (Keychain/Keystore) |
| **Server** | Session tokens with configurable expiration |

## Session limits

Control the number of active sessions per user to prevent accumulation of unused sessions. When the limit is reached, the oldest session is automatically removed.

Configure session limits in your Nuvix Console under **Auth** > **Security** > **Session Limits**. Default limit is 10 sessions per user, with a maximum of 100.

## Permissions system

Nuvix uses a robust permissions model coupled with user sessions to ensure users have correct permissions to access resources. Access is granted at the collection, bucket, document, or file level.

Permissions are enforced for client SDKs and server SDKs when using JWT, but are ignored when using server SDKs with API keys.

## Password security

### Password history

Prevent users from reusing recent passwords. This protects accounts by enforcing new passwords on every change.

Enable password history in your Nuvix Console under **Auth** > **Security** > **Password History**. Choose how many previous passwords to remember (up to 20).

### Password dictionary

Protect users from using common passwords. Nuvix compares passwords against the 10,000 most common passwords and rejects matches.

Enable this feature in **Auth** > **Security** > **Password Dictionary**. Combined with rate limiting, this significantly reduces brute force attacks.

### Password hashing

Nuvix uses the [Argon2](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) password-hashing algorithm - the winner of the Password Hashing Competition. Argon2 combines:

- **Salting**: Unique salt for each password
- **Adjustable work factors**: Configurable computational cost
- **Memory hardness**: Resistant to GPU attacks

If users are imported with different hash formats, passwords are automatically re-hashed with Argon2 on first successful login.

### Personal data protection

Encourage strong passwords by preventing users from choosing passwords containing personal information like name, email, or phone number.

Enable this in **Auth** > **Security** > **Personal Data Protection**.

## Session security

### Session alerts

Enable email alerts so users are notified when new sessions are created for their account. This helps users detect unauthorized access quickly.

Configure session alerts in **Auth** > **Security** > **Session Alerts**.

<Note>
No alerts are sent for Magic URL, Email OTP, or OAuth2 logins since these methods already verify user access to their systems.
</Note>

### Multi-factor authentication

Add an extra layer of security with MFA. Require users to provide a second factor beyond their password for sensitive operations.

## Privacy controls

### Membership privacy

Protect team members' personal information by marking specific membership details as private. This is crucial for apps where privacy is paramount.

Make these details private in **Auth** > **Security** > **Memberships Privacy**:

- `userName` - Member's name
- `userEmail` - Member's email address  
- `mfa` - Whether member has enabled MFA

### Rate limiting

Nuvix implements intelligent rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect your application from attacks. Rate limits are automatically applied to:

- Authentication attempts
- API requests
- Password reset requests
- Session creation

## Development security

### Mock phone numbers

Test SMS authentication without real phone numbers. Create mock numbers with predefined OTP codes for development and testing.

Set up mock numbers in **Auth** > **Security** > **Mock Phone Numbers**.

<Warning>
Only use mock numbers in development environments. Never enable in production.
</Warning>

## Security best practices

### 1. Use HTTPS always
Ensure all communications with Nuvix use HTTPS. The Nuvix client enforces this by default.

### 2. Validate input
Always validate and sanitize user input on both client and server sides.

### 3. Implement proper error handling
Don't expose sensitive information in error messages. Use generic error messages for users.

### 4. Regular security reviews
Periodically review your security settings and update them based on your application's needs.

### 5. Monitor authentication events
Use Nuvix's logging and monitoring features to track authentication events and detect suspicious activity.
