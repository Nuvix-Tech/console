description: Classic authentication done right - secure signup, login, verification, and password recovery with Nuvix's built-in protections.

The authentication method everyone knows. Nuvix handles the security heavy lifting with Argon2 password hashing, built-in validation, and optional features to help users pick better passwords.

## Create an account

Standard signup with email and password:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript/TypeScript
import { Client, ID } from "@nuvix/client";

const nx = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

try {
    const user = await nx.account.create({
        userId: ID.unique(),
        email: 'user@example.com',
        password: 'secure-password'
    });
    console.log('Account created:', user);
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Signup failed:', error);
}
```
</CodeGroup>

**Security built-in:**
- Passwords hashed with Argon2 (industry standard)
- Automatic validation for email format
- Optional password
