Teams allow users to share access to resources. Build collaborative applications where users can create teams, invite members, and manage permissions together.

For example, in a project management app, a user can create a team for their project and invite team members to collaborate. You can assign specific roles to control access to different parts of your application.

## Create team

Create teams with custom roles to organize your users. For example, create a `developers` team with roles like `frontend`, `backend`, `devops`, and `qa`.

The creator automatically gets the `owner` role. **Only owners can invite and remove members**.

```javascript
import { Client } from '@nuvix/client';

const nx = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const team = await nx.teams.create(
    'developers',
    'Development Team',
    ['frontend', 'backend', 'devops', 'qa']
);

console.log('Team created:', team);
```

## Invite team members

Invite members to a team by creating team memberships. Assign roles to control what each member can access.

```javascript
// Invite a team member with specific roles
const membership = await nx.teams.createMembership(
    'developers',
    ['frontend', 'qa'],
    'sarah@example.com',
    'https://yourapp.com/accept-invite'
);

console.log('Invitation sent:', membership);
```

<Info>
Invitations are sent via email with a secure link. Users can accept the invitation to join the team immediately.
</Info>

## Manage team permissions

Control access to your application's resources using team-based permissions. Grant permissions to all team members or specific roles within a team.

### Team-wide permissions

Grant access to all team members:

```javascript
// Allow all team members to access project documents
await databases.createDocument(
    'projects',
    'project123',
    { name: 'New Project' },
    [Permission.read(Role.team('developers'))]
);
```

### Role-specific permissions

Grant access to specific roles within a team:

```javascript
// Only frontend developers can edit UI components
await databases.createDocument(
    'components',
    'button123',
    { type: 'button', label: 'Submit' },
    [
        Permission.read(Role.team('developers')),
        Permission.update(Role.team('developers', ['frontend']))
    ]
);
```

## List team memberships

Get all members of a team and their roles:

```javascript
// Get team memberships
const memberships = await nx.teams.listMemberships('developers');

memberships.memberships.forEach(membership => {
    console.log(`User: ${ membership.userName }`);
    console.log(`Roles: ${ membership.roles.join(', ') }`);
    console.log(`Status: ${ membership.confirm ? 'Active' : 'Pending' }`);
});
```

## Update member roles

Change team member roles as your project needs evolve:

```javascript
// Update member roles
await nx.teams.updateMembership(
    'developers',
    'membership123',
    ['backend', 'devops']
);
```

## Remove team members

Remove members when they no longer need access:

```javascript
await nx.teams.deleteMembership('developers', 'membership123');
```

## Privacy controls

Protect team members' personal information by configuring privacy settings. Navigate to **Auth** > **Security** > **Memberships Privacy** to make these details private:

- `userName` - Member's name
- `userEmail` - Member's email address  
- `mfa` - Whether member has enabled multi-factor authentication

<Warning>
Privacy settings apply globally to all nx.teams. Consider your application's privacy requirements when configuring these settings.
</Warning>

## Best practices

### Team structure

**Organize teams by function:**
```javascript
// Development teams
developers: ['frontend', 'backend', 'devops', 'qa']

// Business teams  
sales: ['manager', 'representative', 'analyst']
marketing: ['content', 'design', 'social']
```

**Organize teams by project:**
```javascript
// Project-based teams
projectAlpha: ['lead', 'developer', 'designer']
projectBeta: ['lead', 'developer', 'tester']
```

### Role naming conventions

Use clear, descriptive role names:
```javascript
// Good
['owner', 'admin', 'editor', 'viewer']

// Avoid
['level1', 'level2', 'user', 'poweruser']
```

### Security considerations

```javascript
// Validate team operations
const validateTeamOperation = async (userId, teamId, requiredRole) => {
    const memberships = await nx.teams.listMemberships(teamId);
    const membership = memberships.memberships.find(m => m.userId === userId);
    
    if (!membership) {
        throw new Error('User is not a team member');
    }
    
    if (!membership.roles.includes(requiredRole) && !membership.roles.includes('owner')) {
        throw new Error('Insufficient permissions');
    }
    
    return true;
};
```

## Common patterns

### Multi-tenant SaaS

Use teams to separate customer data:
```javascript
// Each customer gets their own team
customerTeam = await nx.teams.create(
    'customer-123',
    'Acme Corp',
    ['admin', 'user', 'viewer']
);

// Customer data is isolated by team permissions
database.createDocument('todos', 'todo123', data, [
    Permission.read(Role.team('customer-123')),
    Permission.update(Role.team('customer-123', ['admin']))
]);
```

### Collaborative workspaces

Enable real-time collaboration:
```javascript
// Workspace team with different access levels
workspaceTeam = await nx.teams.create(
    'workspace-alpha',
    'Alpha Workspace', 
    ['owner', 'editor', 'commenter', 'viewer']
);

// Grant permissions based on workspace membership
nx.storage.createFile('documents', 'doc123', file, [
    Permission.read(Role.team('workspace-alpha')),
    Permission.update(Role.team('workspace-alpha', ['owner', 'editor']))
]);
```
