description: Manage users like a pro - Nuvix's Account API handles signup, login, and permissions without the headaches.
---

The Account API is your Swiss Army knife for user management. Create accounts, handle authentication, and control who can access what - all from your client app.

## What you can do

- **Create user accounts** with email, phone, social login, or magic links
- **Authenticate users** and keep them logged in
- **Organize users** into teams with shared permissions
- **Label users** for fine-grained access control
- **Manage permissions** dynamically without touching your backend

## Authentication methods

Pick your flavor. All roads lead to the same account:

- **Email & password** - Classic and reliable
- **Phone verification** - Passwordless convenience  
- **Magic links** - One-click wonder
- **Social login** - GitHub, Google, Facebook, and more
- **Anonymous access** - Try before you buy

## Permission shortcuts

Grant access with built-in roles. No complex setup required:

| Who gets access | Role |
|---------------|------|
| All verified users | `Role.users('verified')` |
| All unverified users | `Role.users('unverified')` |
| Specific verified user | `Role.user(<USER_ID>, 'verified')` |
| Specific unverified user | `Role.user(<USER_ID>, 'unverified')` |
