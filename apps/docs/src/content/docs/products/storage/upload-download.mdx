title: Upload and download
description: Effortlessly upload and download files with Nuvix Storage. Learn how to handle file uploads, manage file versions, and ensure secure downloads in your applications.

You can upload and download files both programmatically using SDKs or through the Nuvix Console.

## Create file

After you create a bucket or have navigated to bucket details, you can access the **Files** tab so you can upload, view, delete and update files in the bucket using the Nuvix project's dashboard. You can also perform all those operations from Nuvix's client SDK, server SDKs, and REST APIs as long as you have the proper permission.

When you are in the **Files** tab, you can click **Add File** and select a file to upload. If the bucket is configured to accept the file type and size you are uploading, your file will be uploaded, and you will see the file in the list of files.

You can also upload files programmatically using our SDKs:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript/TypeScript
import { Client, Storage, ID } from "@nuvix/client";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const storage = new Storage(client);

// Upload file from file input
const file = document.getElementById('uploader').files[0];
const response = await storage.createFile({
    bucketId: '<BUCKET_ID>',
    fileId: ID.unique(),
    file: file
});

console.log(response); // Success
```

```javascript Node.js
import { Client, Storage, ID, InputFile } from "@nuvix/client";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>')
    .setKey('<API_KEY>');

const storage = new Storage(client);

// Upload from file path
const file = InputFile.fromPath('/path/to/file.jpg', 'file.jpg');
const response = await storage.createFile({
    bucketId: '<BUCKET_ID>',
    fileId: ID.unique(),
    file: file
});

console.log(response); // Success
```
</CodeGroup>

## Large files

When you are trying to upload any files above 5MB, you will need to upload them in chunks for better reliability and performance.
If you're using a Nuvix SDK, this is handled automatically.
If you're not using an SDK, you can learn more about REST API file handling in the API documentation.

## InputFile

Every language and platform handles file inputs differently. This section shows the expected input type of each SDK. Where applicable, Nuvix provides an `InputFile` class to accept multiple file sources, like paths, buffers, or plain text.

### Client SDKs

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web">
The Nuvix Web SDK expects a [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) object for file creation. This is most commonly associated with DOM file inputs.

For example, for the input tag `<input type="file" id="uploader">`, you would call create file like this:

```javascript
const response = await storage.createFile({
    bucketId: '<BUCKET_ID>',
    fileId: ID.unique(),
    file: document.getElementById('uploader').files[0]
});
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="React Native">
The Nuvix React Native SDK expects a file object with the following properties for file inputs:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `name` | The name of the file. |
| `type` | The MIME type of the file. |
| `size` | The size of the file in bytes. |
| `uri` | The URI of the file on the device. |

This object structure aligns with what is typically returned from image picker libraries such as `react-native-image-picker`:

```javascript
// Example with react-native-image-picker
import { launchImageLibrary } from 'react-native-image-picker';

const pickImage = async () => {
  const result = await launchImageLibrary({
    mediaType: 'photo',
  });

  if (result.assets && result.assets[0]) {
    const fileInfo = result.assets[0];

    return {
      name: fileInfo.fileName,
      type: fileInfo.type,
      size: fileInfo.fileSize,
      uri: fileInfo.uri,
    };
  }
};
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Server SDKs

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Node.js">
In browser environments, you can use the `File` object directly. For Node.js environments, import the `InputFile` class from 'nuvix/file'.

When using `InputFile`, the following methods are available:

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `InputFile.fromPath(filePath, filename)` | Used to upload files from a provided path. |
| `InputFile.fromBuffer(buffer, filename)` | Used to upload files from a [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer) or [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) object. |
| `InputFile.fromPlainText(content, filename)` | Used to upload files in plain text. Expects a string encoded in UTF-8. |
</Tab>

<Tab title="Deno">
The Nuvix Deno SDK expects an `InputFile` class for file inputs.

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `InputFile.fromPath(filePath, filename)` | Used to upload files from a provided path. |
| `InputFile.fromBuffer(buffer, filename)` | Used to upload files from a [Uint8Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) object. |
| `InputFile.fromPlainText(content, filename)` | Used to upload files in plain text. Expects a string encoded in UTF-8. |
</Tab>

## Get file

To get metadata about a file, use the `getFile` method.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript/TypeScript
import { Client, Storage } from "@nuvix/client";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const storage = new Storage(client);

const file = await storage.getFile({
    bucketId: '<BUCKET_ID>',
    fileId: '<FILE_ID>'
});

console.log(file); // File metadata
```
</CodeGroup>

## Download file

To download a file, use the `getFileDownload` method.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript/TypeScript
import { Client, Storage } from "@nuvix/client";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const storage = new Storage(client);

// Download file data
const fileData = await storage.getFileDownload({
    bucketId: '<BUCKET_ID>',
    fileId: '<FILE_ID>'
});

console.log(fileData); // File data as ArrayBuffer

// Get download URL without downloading
const downloadUrl = storage.getFileDownloadURL({
    bucketId: '<BUCKET_ID>',
    fileId: '<FILE_ID>'
});

console.log(downloadUrl); // URL object
```
</CodeGroup>

## Get File Preview

To get a file preview image, use the `getFilePreview` method.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript/TypeScript
import { Client, Storage } from "@nuvix/client";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const storage = new Storage(client);

// Get preview image data
const previewData = await storage.getFilePreview({
    bucketId: '<BUCKET_ID>',
    fileId: '<FILE_ID>',
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
    quality: 90
});

console.log(previewData); // Image data as ArrayBuffer

// Get preview URL without downloading
const previewUrl = storage.getFilePreviewURL({
    bucketId: '<BUCKET_ID>',
    fileId: '<FILE_ID>',
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
    quality: 90
});

console.log(previewUrl); // URL object
```
</CodeGroup>

## View File

To view a file, use the `getFileView` method.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript/TypeScript
import { Client, Storage } from "@nuvix/client";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const storage = new Storage(client);

// Get file data
const fileData = await storage.getFileView({
    bucketId: '<BUCKET_ID>',
    fileId: '<FILE_ID>'
});

console.log(fileData); // File data as ArrayBuffer

// Get view URL without downloading
const viewUrl = storage.getFileViewURL({
    bucketId: '<BUCKET_ID>',
    fileId: '<FILE_ID>'
});

console.log(viewUrl); // URL object
```
