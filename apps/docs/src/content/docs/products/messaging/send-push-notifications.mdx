# Send push notifications

You can send, schedule, and manage push notifications to your apps using Nuvix Messaging. Push notifications can be used to deliver new message notifications, app updates, promotional offers, and other messages straight to your user's devices.

## 1. Add provider

Push notifications must be sent through third-party providers, like Apple Push Notification service and Firebase Cloud Messaging. The push notification APIs for Apple and Android devices can only be accessed through these services.

You must configure these services before you can send your first push notification.

</CardGroup>

## 2. Add targets

Before sending your first push notification, your application must register itself for push notification, then provide the device token to Nuvix.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Apple with APNs">
First, enable push notification in your app. Add push notification capability to your app by clicking your root-level app in XCode > **Signing & Capabilities** > **Capabilities** > Search for **Push Notifications**.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/docs/messaging/providers/apns/xcode-enable-pn.png" alt="Enable push notifications in Xcode" />
</Frame>

First, register for remote notifications in your app delegate's `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method.

```swift
func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? = nil
) -> Bool {
    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self
    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .badge, .sound]) { granted, _ in
        if granted {
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                application.registerForRemoteNotifications()
            }
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

Next, create a handler for when the app receives the push notification device token.

```swift
func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data
) {
    /* store this `token` */
    let token = deviceToken.map { String(format: "%.2hhx", $0) }.joined()
}
```

Since the token is saved in `UserDefaults`, you can access it from anywhere in your app. With this saved `apnsToken`, you can create a push target with Nuvix when the user logs in. Each push target is associated with an account, here's an example with an email password login. The same logic applies to all types of login methods.

```swift
func login() async {
    do {
        let session = try await nx.account.createEmailPasswordSession(email: username, password: password)

        let token = /* Retrieve the stored push token */

        try await nx.account.createPushTarget({
            targetId: ID.unique(),
            identifier: token
        })
    } catch {
        print("Login failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="FCM for Android">
Before you can send push notifications using FCM, make sure you'd followed the steps to [Add Firebase to your Android project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).

After adding Firebase to your Android project and adding the `google-services.json` to your project, initialize Firebase in your main activity and fetch the FCM registration token.

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        // Initialize Firebase
        FirebaseApp.initializeApp(this)

        // Set the FCM token
        FirebaseMessaging.getInstance().token.addOnCompleteListener(OnCompleteListener { task ->
            if (task.isSuccessful) {
                /* store this `token` */
                val token = task.result
            }
        })
    }
}
```

Nuvix's push targets are associated with accounts. Typically, you would create a push target when the user logs in.

For example, when the user logs in with email and password, your app can register itself as a target after handling the login.

```kotlin
fun login(email: String, password: String) {
    viewModelScope.launch {
        try {
            val session = nx.account.createEmailPasswordSession(email, password)

            let token = /* Retrieve the stored push token */

            /* store the `target.id` */
            val target = nx.account.createPushTarget(
                targetId = ID.unique(),
                identifier = token
            )
        } catch (e: AppwriteException) {
            Log.e("Login", "Failed: ${e.message}")
        }
    }
}
```

Lastly, because FCM push tokens can change, we need to add a service to handle FCM token refreshes and update the target with Nuvix Messaging.

Create a new service that extends `FirebaseMessagingService` which handles the event where the FCM token is updated.

```kotlin
class MessagingService : FirebaseMessagingService() {
    override fun onNewToken(token: String) {
        super.onNewToken(token)

        /* store the `token` */
        /* If the user is logged in, update the push target */
        runBlocking {
            account?.updatePushTarget(/* retrieve saved `target.id` */, token)
        }
    }
}
```

In your `AndroidManifest.xml`, register this new service.

```xml
<service android:name="<YOUR_NOTIFICATION_HANDLER_SERVICE>" android:exported="false">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
    </intent-filter>
</service>
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="FCM for Apple">
Before you can send push notifications using FCM, make sure you'd followed the steps to [Add Firebase to your iOS project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup).

After adding Firebase to your iOS project and adding the `GoogleService-Info.plist` to the root of your project.

Next, add your APNs key to Firebase:
1. Head to **Apple Developer Member Center** > **Program resources** > **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** > **Keys**. The key needs **Apple Push Notification Service** enabled.
2. Create a new key, note down the key ID and download your key.
3. In Firebase console, go to **Settings** > **Cloud Messaging** > **APNs authentication key** > click **Upload**. Upload your key here.
4. Add push notification capability to your app by clicking your root-level app in XCode > **Signing & Capabilities** > **Capabilities** > Search for **Push Notifications**.
5. If using SwiftUI, disable swizzling by setting `FirebaseAppDelegateProxyEnabled` to `NO` in your `Info.plist`.

Initialize Firebase in your app delegate's `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method, implement the messaging delegate protocol, and register for remote notifications.

```swift
func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? = nil
) -> Bool {
    FirebaseApp.configure()
    Messaging.messaging().delegate = self
    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self

    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .badge, .sound]) { granted, _ in
        if granted {
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                application.registerForRemoteNotifications()
            }
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

Your APNS token can change, so you need to handle the token refresh event and update the target with Nuvix Messaging. Implement `didReceiveRegistrationToken`, which is called when the FCM token is updated.

```swift
func messaging(_ messaging: Messaging, didReceiveRegistrationToken fcmToken: String?) {
    /* store the fcmToken */
    guard let fcmToken = fcmToken else { return }

    Task {
        do {
            _ = try await nx.account.get()
            try await nx.account.createPushTarget(targetId: ID.unique(), identifier: fcmToken)
        } catch {
            print("Failed to create push target: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
}
```

Since the token is saved in `UserDefaults`, you can access it from anywhere in your app. With this saved `fcmToken`, you can create a push target with Nuvix when the user logs in. Each push target is associated with an account, here's an example with an email password login. The same logic applies to all types of login methods.

```swift
func login() async {
    do {
        let session = try await nx.account.createEmailPasswordSession(email: username, password: password)

        let token = /* Retrieve stored push token */

        let target = try await nx.account.createPushTarget(targetId: ID.unique(), identifier: token)
    } catch {
        print("Login failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```

If you have disabled method swizzling, or you are building a SwiftUI app, you'll need to explicitly map your APNs token to the FCM registration token. Implement the `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken` method to get the device token and save it to FCM.

```swift
func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data
) {
    Messaging.messaging().apnsToken = deviceToken
}
```
</Tab>

## 3. Request permissions

Your app must ask for permission to receive push notification from the user.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Apple with APNs">
Before your app can receive push notifications, you need to request the user for permissions. Nuvix provides a utility to help request permissions to display notifications.

You can learn more about requesting permissions from the [Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/asking-permission-to-use-notifications).
</Tab>

<Tab title="FCM for Android">
First, add `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` to your `AndroidManifest.xml`.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="YOUR_PACKAGE">
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS"/>
    <!-- ... rest of your manifest -->
```

Then, you'll also need to request [runtime permissions](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting) from your users using the `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission.
</Tab>

<Tab title="FCM for Apple">
Before your app can receive push notifications, you need to request the user for permissions. Nuvix provides a utility to help request permissions to display notifications.

You can learn more about requesting permissions from the [Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/asking-permission-to-use-notifications).

When an FCM registration token is generated, the library uploads the identifier and configuration data to Firebase. If you wish to give your users the ability to explicitly opt out of sending data to Firebase, you can disable automatic initialization and manually initialize the library when the user grants permission.

Disable auto-initialization by setting `FirebaseMessagingAutoInitEnabled` to `NO` in your `Info.plist`.

```text
FirebaseMessagingAutoInitEnabled = NO
```

Then, manually initialize the library when the user grants permission.

```swift
Messaging.messaging().autoInitEnabled = true
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## 4. Send message

You can send messages in both the Nuvix Console and programmatically using the Nuvix Server SDK.

<Info>
**Sandbox**

If you enabled **Sandbox** on your APNs provider, Nuvix will send push notifications to the development APNs environment. This requires you to use a **Development profile** in XCode.

If XCode is not default to a development profile, click your root-level app in XCode > **Signing & Capabilities** > **Capabilities** > uncheck **Automatically manage signing**. Then manually select a **Provisioning profile** that is a **Distribution profile**.
</Info>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Console">
To send a test message, navigate to **Messaging** > **Messages** > **Create message** > **Push notification**.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/docs/messaging/messages/create-push-notification.png" alt="Create push notification interface" />
</Frame>

Add your message and in the targets step, select one of your test targets. Set the schedule to **Now** and click **Send**.

Verify that you can receive the message on your device. If not, check for logs in the Nuvix Console or in your provider's logs.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Server SDK">
To send a message programmatically, use the Nuvix Server SDK.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript
import { Client } from '@nuvix/client';

const nx = new Client()
  .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
  .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>')
