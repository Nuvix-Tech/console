# SendGrid

SendGrid lets you send customized email messages to your users. These emails can be sent immediately or scheduled. You can send emails for purposes like reminders, promotions, announcements, and even custom authentication flows.

## 1. Add provider

To add SendGrid as a provider, navigate to **Messaging** > **Providers** > **Add provider** > **Email**.

Give your provider a name > choose **SendGrid** > click **Save and continue**. The provider will be saved to your project, but not enabled until you complete its configuration.

## 2. Configure provider

In the **Configure** step, you will need to provide details from your SendGrid dashboard to connect your Nuvix project.

You will need to provide the following information from your **SendGrid dashboard**:

| Field name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **API key** | Head to Settings > API Keys > Create API Key. |
| **Sender email** | The provider sends emails from this sender email. The sender email must either be an email under an [authenticated domain](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication) or a [verified sender identity](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/ui/sending-email/sender-verification). |
| **Sender name** | The sender name that appears in the emails sent from this provider. |
| **Reply-to email** | The reply-to email that appears in the emails sent from this provider. The reply-to email must either be an email under an authenticated domain or a verified sender identity. |
| **Reply-to name** | The reply-to name that appears in the emails sent from this provider. |

After adding the following details, click **Save and continue** to enable the provider.

## 3. Test provider

Before sending your first message, make sure you've configured [a topic](/products/messaging/topics) and [a target](/products/messaging/targets) to send messages to.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Console">
To send a test message, navigate to **Messaging** > **Messages** > **Create message** > **Email**.

Add your message and in the targets step, select one of your test targets. Set the schedule to **Now** and click **Send**.

Verify that you can receive the message in your inbox. If not, check for logs in the Nuvix Console or in your provider's logs.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Server SDK">
To send a message programmatically, use the Nuvix Server SDK.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript
import { Client } from '@nuvix/client';

const nx = new Client()
  .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
  .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>')
  .setKey('<API_KEY>');

const message = await nx.messaging.createEmail({
  messageId: '<MESSAGE_ID>',
  subject: '<SUBJECT>',
  content: '<CONTENT>'
});
```
</CodeGroup>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

You can follow the [Send email messages](/products/messaging/send-email-messages) journey to send your first email and test your provider.

## 4. Manage provider

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Console">
You can update or delete a provider in the Nuvix Console.

Navigate to **Messaging** > **Providers** > click your provider. In the settings, you can update a provider's configuration or delete the provider.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Server SDK">
To update or delete providers programmatically, use the Nuvix Server SDK.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript
import { Client } from '@nuvix/client';

const nx = new Client()
  .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
  .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>')
  .setKey('<API_KEY>');

// update provider
const provider = await nx.messaging.updateSendgridProvider(
  '<PROVIDER_ID>',
  '<NAME>',                    // name (optional)
  '<API_KEY>',                 // apiKey (optional)
  false,                       // enabled (optional)
  '<FROM_NAME>',               // fromName (optional)
  'email@example.com',         // fromEmail (optional)
  '<REPLY_TO_NAME>',           // replyToName (optional)
  '<REPLY_TO_EMAIL>'           // replyToEmail (optional)
);

// delete provider
await nx.messaging.deleteProvider('<PROVIDER_ID>');
```
