# Targets

Targets are different ways a user can be reached.
For example, a user might have two emails, a phone number as well as a phone and a tablet with your app installed.
This means, the user has five different targets that you can deliver messages to.

## Topics and targets

A user can have multiple targets, such as emails, phone numbers, and devices with your app installed. 
These targets can subscribe to a topic, so when messages are published to a topic, all subscribed targets receive the message.

## Types of targets

There are three types of targets you can use to reach your users:

| Target Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Email** | Allows you to send emails to the user's email address. |
| **SMS** | Allows you to send SMS messages to the user's phone number. |
| **Push notification** | Allows you to send push notifications to the user's device. |

## Add a target

Before you can send messages, make sure you have the appropriate targets added for your user.

### Add email target

Verified emails for users that signed up with [email password](/products/auth/email-password), [magic URL](/products/auth/magic-url), and [email OTP](/products/auth/email-otp) login will already have an email target.

### Add SMS target

Verified phone numbers for users that signed up with [Phone OTP](/products/auth/phone-sms) login will already have a phone target.

### Add push notification target

Push notifications require configuration on both the Nuvix platform and your client app's code.
