# Topics

In Nuvix Messaging, you can use topics to deliver messages to groups of users at once.

<Frame caption="Topics overview">

</Frame>

## Topics and targets

A user can have multiple targets, such as emails, phone numbers, and devices with your app installed.
These targets can subscribe to a topic, so when messages are published to a topic, all subscribed targets receive the message.

  Understand how targets work with topics to deliver messages
</Card>

## Organizing topics

A topic should have semantic meaning.
For example, a topic can represent a group of customers that receiving a common announcement or publishing public updates.
It's important to keep privacy in mind when using topics.
Prefer sending private information like chat messages by addressing individual targets attached to a user.

Topics are optimized for delivering the same message to large groups of users.
If you need to deliver messages to **all devices of the same user**, you can find a user's targets by calling `nx.account.get()`.

## Create a topic

  .setKey('<API_KEY>');

const topic = await nx.messaging.createTopic({
  topicId: '<TOPIC_ID>',
  name: '<NAME>',
  subscribe: ['<ROLES>']  // permission roles for who can subscribe
});

## Permissions

You can set permission by navigating to **Messaging** > **Topics** > select a topic to configure > **Subscription access**.
