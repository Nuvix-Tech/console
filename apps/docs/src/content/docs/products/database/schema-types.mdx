Nuvix Database provides three schema types, each optimized for different use cases and levels of control. Use this guide to choose the right approach for your application.

## Document Schema

A NoSQL-style abstraction over PostgreSQL designed for rapid prototyping and developer-friendly use. Document schemas do not require SQL and expose document-based APIs for simplicity and speed.

### Key features
- **NoSQL interface**: JSON-based document CRUD operations
- **Collection-based**: Data organized into collections with user-defined attributes
- **Query operators**: Rich filtering and search capabilities
- **ACL permissions**: Custom access control at collection and document levels

### API structure
```http
/v1/schemas/:schema/collections/:collection/documents
```

### Common use cases
- Rapid prototyping without SQL knowledge
- Dynamic, flexible data models
- NoSQL-style applications
- Mobile and web app backends

### Data definition
- Collections defined via API
- Attributes declared per collection
- Indexes for performance optimization
- No direct SQL table management required

<Note>
Document schemas offer read-only SQL access. Use the API layer for any data modifications.
</Note>

## Managed Schema

A PostgreSQL schema governed by Nuvix automation. Managed schemas generate metadata, permission tables, and RLS policies automatically. This approach balances control and convenience.

### Key features
- **Full SQL support**: Complete PostgreSQL querying capabilities
- **Automatic RLS**: Row Level Security policies generated automatically
- **Permission automation**: Automatic creation of permission tables
- **Nuvix governance**: Simplified management with built-in best practices

### Built-in automation
- Automatic `_id` column for each table
- Automatic `[table]_perms` table for permissions
- RLS enabled with CRUD policies generated
- DDL triggers handle policy generation

### API structure
```http
/v1/schemas/:schema/tables/:table
```

### Common use cases
- Production-grade relational applications
- Multi-tenant systems
- Enterprise apps requiring structured data governance
- Applications needing both SQL and API access

<Check>
Managed schemas provide the best of both worlds: Postgres power with Nuvix automation.
</Check>
<Note>
You can also define custom RLS policies and triggers if needed, but the automated system covers most use cases.
</Note>

## Unmanaged Schema

A raw Postgres schema exposed through the Nuvix API without automation. You get complete control over schema design, SQL queries, and access policies.

### Key features
- **Full Postgres control**: Complete schema and permission management
- **No automation**: No automatic RLS or permission tables
- **Manual governance**: User-defined access controls and policies
- **Maximum flexibility**: Custom constraints, indexes, and relationships

### API structure
```http
/v1/schemas/:schema/tables/:table
```

### Common use cases
- Advanced SQL workloads
- Legacy database migrations
- Custom governance systems
- Complex relational designs

<Warning>
Unmanaged schemas require manual setup of permissions and RLS policies. Choose this option only if you need complete control.
</Warning>

## Choosing the right schema type

| Use case | Recommended type | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Quick prototyping | Document | No SQL required, fastest setup |
| Production app with SQL | Managed | Automated security with full SQL access |
| Legacy migration | Unmanaged | Complete control over existing schema |
| Complex relationships | Managed/Unmanaged | Full PostgreSQL feature support |
| NoSQL-style app | Document | Document-based API simplicity |
