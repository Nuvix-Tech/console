description: A unified, schema-based data layer built on PostgreSQL with structured REST APIs and flexible schema types.
---

Every Nuvix project includes a fully managed PostgreSQL instance. PostgreSQL powers financial systems, global commerce platforms, and high-scale applications. Nuvix extends this foundation with a unified, schema-driven data layer designed for modern development.

## Three ways to work with your data

Nuvix provides three schema types, each suited to different needs. Pick one or combine them in the same project.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Document Schema" href="/products/database/schema-types#document-schema" icon="file-text">
NoSQL-style JSON documents with collections, attributes, and powerful query operators. No SQL required.
</Card>
<Card title="Managed Schema" href="/products/database/schema-types#managed-schema" icon="shield">
Full PostgreSQL with automatic Row Level Security, permission tables, and API generation.
</Card>
<Card title="Unmanaged Schema" href="/products/database/schema-types#unmanaged-schema" icon="database">
Raw PostgreSQL access. Complete control over tables, policies, and constraints.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Architecture

Nuvix Database is built on PostgreSQL and inherits its enterprise-grade reliability, ACID compliance, and advanced capabilities. Each schema type offers a different balance between abstraction and control.

| Feature | Document | Managed | Unmanaged |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SQL access | Read-only | Full | Full |
| API access | Full CRUD | Full CRUD | Full CRUD |
| Automatic RLS | N/A | Yes | No |
| Permission tables | N/A | Auto-generated | Manual |
| Schema management | API-only | SQL + API | SQL + API |
| Best for | Rapid prototyping | Production apps | Advanced workloads |

## Terminology

- **Schema**: A logical grouping of database objects within PostgreSQL. Each schema operates independently.
- **Collection**: A container for documents in Document schemas. Similar to a table but with a JSON document structure.
- **Attribute**: A field definition within a collection. Specifies type, validation rules, and constraints.
- **Document**: A single record within a collection. Stored as a JSON object with system fields.
- **Table**: A standard PostgreSQL table in Managed or Unmanaged schemas.
