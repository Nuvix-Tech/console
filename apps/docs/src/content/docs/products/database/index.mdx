Every Nuvix project includes a fully managed PostgreSQL instance. PostgreSQL is trusted across financial systems, global commerce, and high-scale platforms for its stability, performance, and advanced features. Nuvix leverages this foundation and extends it with a unified, schema-driven data layer designed for modern development.

## What is Nuvix Database?

Nuvix Database is a unified, schema-based data layer built on PostgreSQL. It offers three schema types: Document, Managed, and Unmanaged. Choose the level of abstraction and control that fits your needs, from rapid prototyping to production at scale.

## Core Principles

- **Schema isolation**: Each schema operates independently within your project.
- **Flexible access**: Managed and Unmanaged schemas support full SQL; Document schemas are API-only.

## Architecture
Built on PostgreSQL, Nuvix provides enterprise-grade reliability, ACID compliance, and advanced capabilities. Each schema type balances abstraction and control differently, ranging from automated security to fully manual configuration.
## Schema Creation
Schemas are created through the Nuvix API or Console. Direct creation of PostgreSQL databases or roles is not permitted; these are governed by Nuvix's internal metadata system to ensure security and consistency.

## Terminology
- **Postgres**: An advanced open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its robustness and extensibility, also referred to as PostgreSQL.
- **Schema**: A logical grouping of database objects (tables, views, functions) within a PostgreSQL database.
- **Document Schema**: A schema optimized for JSON document storage and retrieval via REST APIs. (also called Doc Schema)
- **Managed Schema**: A schema with automated security and API generation, allowing SQL access.
- **Unmanaged Schema**: A schema providing full control over database objects and security, with SQL access.
