description: Explore how Nuvix Database unifies structured and unstructured data with PostgreSQL-backed schemas and fine-grained access control.
---

Nuvix provides a **multi-schema data architecture** built on PostgreSQL, combining the flexibility of NoSQL with the robustness and performance of SQL — all exposed through a unified API layer.

<Callout type="info">
Every Nuvix schema is a PostgreSQL schema under the hood.  
You can create unlimited schemas of any type and expose them securely through the Nuvix API.
</Callout>

## Overview

The **Nuvix Database** forms the foundation of your application’s data layer.  
It offers:
- **Unified APIs** for querying and managing data across schema types.  
- **Built-in permission enforcement** through ACLs and RLS.  
- **Schema-driven modeling** for both NoSQL and SQL users.  
- **API-driven governance** without direct SQL connections.

## Schema Types

Nuvix supports three types of schemas. Each type offers a different balance between structure, control, and flexibility — yet all share the same API design philosophy.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Document Schemas" href="/docs/database/document-schemas" icon="notion">
    NoSQL-style collections with defined attributes, indexes, and ACLs. SQL access is read-only.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Managed Schemas" href="/docs/database/managed-schemas" icon="database">
    SQL tables with automation — RLS, policies, and permission tables generated automatically.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Unmanaged Schemas" href="/docs/database/unmanaged-schemas" icon="terminal">
    Full SQL freedom with manual control, still managed and exposed via Nuvix API.

## Key Features

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Unified API Access">
    All schema types are accessible through the same API endpoints and SDK methods, simplifying data operations across different models.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Permission Enforcement">
    Document Schemas use ACL-based control, while Managed Schemas rely on PostgreSQL RLS and generated permission tables.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Schema Flexibility">
    Mix NoSQL-style collections with fully relational tables — each schema is isolated yet shareable under one PostgreSQL instance.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="API-First Governance">
    Schemas, tables, and permissions are managed entirely through the Nuvix API or Console. No direct SQL connections are required.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Choosing the Right Schema

| Schema Type | SQL Access | Best For | Permission Model | Flexibility | Governance |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Document** | ❌ Read-only | Rapid prototyping, unstructured data | ACL (Collection / Document level) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | API-driven |
| **Managed** | ✅ Full | Structured app data | RLS + `_perms` + Policies | ⭐⭐⭐ | API-driven |
| **Unmanaged** | ✅ Full | Custom SQL, integrations | Manual (user-defined) | ⭐⭐ | API-driven |

<Tip>
Choose **Document Schemas** for flexible and fast development, and **Managed Schemas** when you need structure, relations, and strong access control.
</Tip>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Create a Schema">
    Use the Console or API to create a schema of any type — Document, Managed, or Unmanaged.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Define Structure">
    In Document Schemas, define attributes and indexes.  
    In Managed/Unmanaged, define SQL tables and relations.
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Configure Permissions">
    Apply ACL rules (Document) or enable RLS (Managed) to protect your data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Access Through API">
    Query and mutate data using the unified REST or SDK interfaces.
  </Step>
</Steps>
