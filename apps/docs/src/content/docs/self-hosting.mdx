description: Deploy Nuvix on your own infrastructure using Docker.
---

Nuvix is designed to be self-hosted on any provider that supports Docker. This guide will walk you through setting up a production-ready Nuvix instance using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your server (Ubuntu/Debian recommended):

- **Docker Engine** (v20.10+)
- **Docker Compose** (v2.0+)
- **Git** (optional, for cloning)

## 1. Get the Docker Compose file

You can either clone the repository or download the `docker-compose.yml` file directly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nuvix-tech/nuvix.git
cd nuvix
```

## 2. Configuration

Nuvix uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file from the example.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Critical Environment Variables

Edit the `.env` file and update the following security keys. You should generate random strings for these values.

```text
# Database Security
NUVIX_DATABASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me-to-secure-password
NUVIX_DATABASE_PASSWORD=change-me-to-secure-password

# Application Secrets
NUVIX_APP_SECRET=generate-a-long-random-string
NUVIX_JWT_SECRET=generate-a-long-random-string

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

## 3. Start Nuvix

Run the following command to start the Nuvix stack in detached mode.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Docker will pull the necessary images (`nuvix/postgres`, `redis`, etc.) and start the services.

### Check Status

Verify that all containers are running:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

You should see the following services:
- `server`: The main API server (Port 4000)
- `platform`: The Nuvix Console (Port 4100)
- `postgres`: Database
- `redis`: Cache

## 4. Access the Console

Once the services are up, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://<your-server-ip>:4100
```

You should see the Nuvix Console login screen. Create your root admin account to get started.

## Updating Nuvix

To upgrade to the latest version, pull the new images and restart the stack.

```bash
# 1. Pull latest images
docker compose pull

# 2. Recreate containers
docker compose up -d
```

## Troubleshooting

### Logs

If something isn't working, check the logs for specific services.

```bash
# View server logs
docker compose logs -f server

# View database logs
docker compose logs -f postgres
```

### Database Connection

Ensure the `postgres` container is healthy before the server starts. If the server crashes on startup, it might be waiting for the database to become ready. Nuvix handles this automatically with `depends_on`, but a manual restart often fixes timing issues on slower machines.

```bash
docker compose restart server
```
