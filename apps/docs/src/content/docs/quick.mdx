Type-safe, modular SDKs and consistent APIs make building and extending your application effortless. Hooks and event-driven architecture allow customization without touching core logic.

### Secure by Design

Industry-standard practices including Argon2 password hashing, JWT authentication, role-based access control, and row/column-level security.

### Multi-platform

Support for web, mobile, and server environments with native SDKs and portable APIs that scale across platforms.

### Performance & Scalability

Optimized for low-latency and high throughput with connection pooling, edge-friendly routing, caching layers, and efficient query execution.
