Nuvix provides a complete backend-as-a-service. This guide will get you from zero to a running application in minutes.

## 1. Create a Project

Everything in Nuvix starts with a **Project**.

1.  Log in to the [Nuvix Console](https://console.nuvix.in).
2.  Click **Create Project**.
3.  Give it a name (e.g., "My Awesome App") and a unique ID.

<Note>
Save your **Project ID**. You'll need it to initialize the SDK.
</Note>

## 2. Install the SDK

Nuvix provides type-safe SDKs for your client applications.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @nuvix/client
```
```bash yarn
yarn add @nuvix/client
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @nuvix/client
```
</CodeGroup>

## 3. Initialize the Client

Initialize the SDK in your application's entry point (e.g., `App.js`, `main.ts`).

```typescript
import { Client } from '@nuvix/client';

const nx = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1') // Your API Endpoint
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>'); // Your Project ID
```

## 4. Make Your First Request

Let's test the connection by creating an anonymous session. This verifies that your app can talk to Nuvix.

```typescript
import { Client, Account } from '@nuvix/client';

const nx = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const account = new Account(nx);

// Create an anonymous session
const session = await account.createAnonymousSession();

console.log('Logged in as guest:', session.$id);
```

## Server-Side Access

For backend scripts or administrative tasks, use the REST API with an **API Key**.

1.  In the Console, go to **Settings** > **API Keys**.
2.  Create a key with the scopes you need (e.g., `documents.read`, `users.write`).
3.  Pass the key in the `X-API-Key` header.

```bash
curl -H "X-Project-ID: <PROJECT_ID>" \
     -H "X-API-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
     https://api.nuvix.in/v1/users
```
