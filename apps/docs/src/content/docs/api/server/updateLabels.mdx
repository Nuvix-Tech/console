          Update the user labels by its unique ID. 


          Labels can be used to grant access to resources. While teams are a way
          for user's to share access to a resource, labels can be defined by the
          developer to grant access without an invitation. See the [Permissions
          docs](https://docs.nuvix.in/permissions) for more info.
