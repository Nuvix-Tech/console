          Allow the user to login to their account using the OAuth2 provider of
          their choice. Each OAuth2 provider should be enabled from the Nuvix
          console first. Use the success and failure arguments to provide a
          redirect URL's back to your app when login is completed. 


          If authentication succeeds, `userId` and `secret` of a token will be
          appended to the success URL as query parameters. These can be used to
          create a new session using the [Create
          session](https://docs.nuvix.in/references/cloud/client-web/account#createSession)
          endpoint.


          A user is limited to 10 active sessions at a time by default. [Learn
          more about session
          limits](https://docs.nuvix.in/authentication-security#limits).
