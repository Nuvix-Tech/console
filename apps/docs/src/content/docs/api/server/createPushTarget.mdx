          Use this endpoint to register a device for push notifications. Provide
          a target ID (custom or generated using ID.unique()), a device
          identifier (usually a device token), and optionally specify which
          provider should send notifications to this target. The target is
          automatically linked to the current session and includes device
          information like brand and model.
