          Allow the user to login to their account using the OAuth2 provider of
          their choice. Each OAuth2 provider should be enabled from the Nuvix
          console first. Use the success and failure arguments to provide a
          redirect URL's back to your app when login is completed.


          If there is already an active session, the new session will be
          attached to the logged-in account. If there are no active sessions,
          the server will attempt to look for a user with the same email address
          as the email received from the OAuth2 provider and attach the new
          session to the existing user. If no matching user is found - the
          server will create a new user.


          A user is limited to 10 active sessions at a time by default. [Learn
          more about session
          limits](https://docs.nuvix.in/authentication-security#limits).
