          Use this endpoint to allow a new user to register an anonymous account
          in your project. This route will also create a new session for the
          user. To allow the new user to convert an anonymous account to a
          normal account, you need to update its [email and
          password](https://docs.nuvix.in/references/cloud/client-web/account#updateEmail)
          or create an [OAuth2
          session](https://docs.nuvix.in/references/cloud/client-web/account#CreateOAuth2Session).
