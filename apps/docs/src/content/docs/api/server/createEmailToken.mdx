          Sends the user an email with a secret key for creating a session. If
          the email address has never been used, a **new account is created**
          using the provided `userId`. Otherwise, if the email address is
          already attached to an account, the **user ID is ignored**. Then, the
          user will receive an email with the one-time password. Use the
          returned user ID and secret and submit a request to the [POST
          /v1/account/sessions/token](https://docs.nuvix.in/references/cloud/client-web/account#createSession)
          endpoint to complete the login process. The secret sent to the user's
          email is valid for 15 minutes.


          A user is limited to 10 active sessions at a time by default. [Learn
          more about session
          limits](https://docs.nuvix.in/authentication-security#limits).
