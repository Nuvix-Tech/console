          Sends the user an email with a secret key for creating a session. If
          the provided user ID has not been registered, a new user will be
          created. When the user clicks the link in the email, the user is
          redirected back to the URL you provided with the secret key and userId
          values attached to the URL query string. Use the query string
          parameters to submit a request to the [POST
          /v1/account/sessions/token](https://docs.nuvix.in/references/cloud/client-web/account#createSession)
          endpoint to complete the login process. The link sent to the user's
          email address is valid for 1 hour.


          A user is limited to 10 active sessions at a time by default. [Learn
          more about session
          limits](https://docs.nuvix.in/authentication-security#limits).
