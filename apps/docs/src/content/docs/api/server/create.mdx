          Use this endpoint to allow a new user to register a new account in
          your project. After the user registration completes successfully, you
          can use the
          [/account/verfication](https://docs.nuvix.in/references/cloud/client-web/account#createVerification)
          route to start verifying the user email address. To allow the new user
          to login to their new account, you need to create a new [account
          session](https://docs.nuvix.in/references/cloud/client-web/account#createEmailSession).
