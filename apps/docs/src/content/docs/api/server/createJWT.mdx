          Use this endpoint to create a JSON Web Token. You can use the
          resulting JWT to authenticate on behalf of the current user when
          working with the Nuvix server-side API and SDKs. The JWT secret is
          valid for 15 minutes from its creation and will be invalid if the user
          will logout in that time frame.
