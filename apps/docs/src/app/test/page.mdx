Appwrite supports multiple protocols for accessing the server, including [REST](/docs/apis/rest), [GraphQL](/docs/apis/graphql), and [Realtime](/docs/apis/realtime). The REST API allows you to access your Appwrite server through HTTP requests without the needing an SDK. Each endpoint in the API represents a specific operation on a specific resource.

# Headers


Appwrite's REST APIs expect certain headers to be included with each request:

- Header
- 
- Description
---
- X-Appwrite-Project: [PROJECT-ID]
- required
- The ID of your Appwrite project
---
- Content-Type: application/json
- required
- Content type of the HTTP request. Would usually be `application/json`.
---
- X-Appwrite-Key: [API-KEY]
- optional
- API key used for server authentication. Your API key is a secret, **do not** use it in client applications.
---
- X-Appwrite-JWT: [TOKEN]
- optional
- Token used for JWT authentication, tokens can be generated using the [Create JWT](/docs/products/auth/jwt) method.
---
- X-Appwrite-Response-Format: [VERSION-NUMBER]
- optional
- Version number used for backward compatibility. The response will be formatted to be compatible with the provided version number. This helps Appwrite SDKs keep backward compatibility with Appwrite server API version.
---
- X-Fallback-Cookies: [FALLBACK-COOKIES]
- optional
- Fallback cookies used in scenarios where browsers do not allow third-party cookies. Often used when there is no Custom Domain set for your Appwrite API.

## Query string format 

Appwrite Queries are escaped JSON strings, which look like this.

```json
"{\"method\":\"equal\",\"attribute\":\"name\",\"values\":[\"John\"]}"
```

Query strings are passed to Appwrite using the `queries` parameter. 
You can attach multiple query strings by including the array parameter multiple times in the query string: `queries[]="..."&queries[]="..."`

For example, the unescaped query string might look like this.
```text
?queries[0]={"method":"equal","attribute":"name","values":["John"]}&queries[1]={"method":"limit","values":[6]}
```

The JSON has a general format like this.

```json
{
  "method": "<QUERY_METHOD>",
  "attribute": "<ATTRIBUTE>",
  "values": [
    <VALUE1>,
    <VALUE2>,
    ...
  ]
}
```



For example, to query for all documents with the name "John" or "Jane", the query string would look like this.

```json
{
  "method": "equal",
  "attribute": "name",
  "values": [
    "John",
    "Jane"
  ]
}
```

Here are some more examples of the JSON query format. 
When in doubt, you can use the Appwrite SDKs to generate the query strings for you.

```json
{
  "method": "isNull",
  "attribute": "name"
}
{
  "method": "select",
  "values": ["name", "age", "email"]
}
{
  "method": "between",
  "attribute": "age",
  "values": [18, 30]
}
{
  "method": "cursorAfter",
  "values": ["documentId"]
}
```

## Query nesting 
Some Appwrite query methods, like `and` and `or`, allow you to nest queries. 
When using Appwrite without an SDK, you can template your own JSON strings.

In these cases, `attribute` is empty and `values` is an array of queries.

```json
{
  "method": "and",
  "values": [
    {
      "method": "equal",
      "attribute": "name",
      "values": ["John"]
    },
    {
      "method": "between",
      "attribute": "age",
      "values": [20, 30]
    }
  ]
}
```

# Rate limits

Appwrite's REST APIs are protected by the same rate limit policies, just like when using an SDK. Each API has a different rate limit, which is documented in the References section of each service in the Appwrite documentation.

# Specifications

Appwrite provides a full REST API specification in the OpenAPI 3 and Swagger 2 formats every release. These can be accessed through Appwrite's GitHub repository and rendered using a variety of parsers and tools.
